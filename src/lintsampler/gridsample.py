def gridsample(*edgearrays, f, N_samples=None, seed=None):
    """Draw sample(s) from density function defined on k-D grid.
    
    Given a k-dimensional grid shaped :math:`(N_0, N_1, ..., N_{k-1})`, the user
    specifies a sequence of k 1D arrays (lengths :math:`N_0+1, N_1+1`, etc.)
    representing the (not necessarily evenly spaced) gridlines along each
    dimension, and a kD array shaped :math:`(N_0+1, N_1+1, ...)` representing
    the (not necessarily normalised) densities at the grid corners. This
    function then draws a sample (or N samples) from this grid. It first chooses
    a cell (or N cells with replacement), weighting them by their mass
    (estimated by the trapezoid rule) then samples from k-linear interpolant
    within the chosen cell(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    *edgearrays : one or more 1D array_like
        k arrays representing 'edge lines' of k-dimensional grid. E.g., if grid
        is 3D and shaped N0 x N1 x N2, then provide 3 1D arrays, shaped (N0+1,),
        (N1+1,), (N2+1,) respectively. The edges do *not* need to be evenly
        spaced.
    f : k-D array_like, shape (N0+1 x N1+1 x ... x N{k-1}+1)
        Grid of densities evaluated at vertices of k-dimensional grid. Densities
        should all be positive.
    N_samples : {None, int}, optional
        Number of samples to draw. Default is None, in which case a single
        sample is drawn.
    seed : {None, int, ``numpy.random.Generator``}, optional
        Seed for ``numpy`` random generator. Can be random generator itself, in
        which case it is left unchanged. Default is None, in which case new
        default generator is created. See ``numpy`` random generator docs for
        more information.

    Returns
    -------
    X : scalar, 1D array (length k OR N_samples) or 2D array (N_samples, k)
        Sample(s) from linear interpolant. Scalar if single sample (i.e.,
        N_samples is None) in 1D. 1D array if single sample in k-D OR multiple
        samples in 1D. 2D array if multiple samples in k-D.
    
    Examples
    --------
    
    These examples demonstrate the multiple ways to use ``gridsample``. In
    each case, we'll just generate densities from a uniform distribution, but
    in general they might come from any arbitrary density function.

    1. A single sample from a 1D grid. The grid spans x=0 to x=10, and has 32
    cells (so 33 edges). 
    
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 33)
    >>> f = np.random.uniform(size=33)
    >>> gridsample(x, f=f)
    0.7355598727871656

    This returns a single scalar: the sampling point within the grid.
    
    2. Multiple samples from a 1D grid (same grid as previous example).
    
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 33)
    >>> f = np.random.uniform(size=33)
    >>> gridsample(x, f=f, N_samples=4)
    array([0.7432799 , 6.64118763, 9.65968316, 5.39087554])

    This returns a 1D array: the ``N_samples`` sampling points within the grid.

    3. Single sample from a k-D grid. In this case we'll take a 2D grid, with
    32 x 64 cells (so 33 gridlines along one axis and 65 along the other, and
    33x65=2145 intersections with known densities).
    
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 33)
    >>> y = np.linspace(100, 200, 65)
    >>> f = np.random.uniform(size=(33, 65))
    >>> gridsample(x, y, f=f)
    array([  7.67294632, 190.45302915])

    This returns a 1D array: the single k-D sampling point within the grid.

    4. Multiple samples from a k-D grid (same grid as previous example).
    
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 33)
    >>> y = np.linspace(100, 200, 65)
    >>> f = np.random.uniform(size=(33, 65))
    >>> gridsample(x, y, f=f, N_samples=5)
    array([[1.35963966e-01, 1.38182930e+02],
           [6.52704300e+00, 1.63109912e+02],
           [4.35226761e+00, 1.49753235e+02],
           [3.56093155e+00, 1.48548481e+02],
           [1.31163401e+00, 1.59335676e+02]])

    This returns a 2D array, shape ``N_samples`` x k: the ``N_samples`` k-D
    samples within the grid.
